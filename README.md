# README

This contains simple terraform scripts, to create an iam role, an iam policy, spin up a new ec2 instance and attach the role to that instance. 

This was completely done based on the samples provided in the official documentation of Terraform and [Kulasanger's similar example](https://github.com/Kulasangar/terraform-demo.git).

## Terraform Commands

``` bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
